Materials for [Devroad](http://devroad.tech) project.

## How to contribute
1. Everybody is welcomed to add links to articles, videos and other materials that help learn software development.
2. Add tags if you feel that there's no suitable tag for your material.
3. Fix or let me know if some materials are no more relevant, have broken link or moved to another address.
4. [Drop me a line](mailto:mail@colomolome.com) if you have suggestions or comments on the project.

### Files to modify
1. [`data.js`](/lib/data.js) - for your links. Please add a brief summary of material.
2. [`tags.js`](/lib/tags.js) - for tags.

Please open a Pull Request with your changes, and I will review it as fast as I can.

### Materials worth adding
Devroad is intended to be a helpful resource for all kinds of developers, both novices and highly skilled professionals, working in the industry for significant amount of time.

So do not hesitate to add materials that seem 'obvious' or too easy for you. They could be a great help to those who just starting their journey in a software development world.

Add materials that you would recommend to your younger self or that could be used as a reference. Some materials are worth rereading once in a while, they are wanted here too.

### Materials not worth adding
Please do not add links to official documentation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. (eg. Official React documentation).

Do not add links to answers on common questions that have been asked (and answered) thousands of times and could be googled easily. Devroad is meant to be more like a book on different aspects of software development rather than Q&A session.
